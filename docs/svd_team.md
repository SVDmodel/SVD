# SVD team

[Werner Rammer](http://www.wabo.boku.ac.at/rammer.html) 
and [Rupert Seidl](http://www.wabo.boku.ac.at/seidl.html), both currently at 
[BOKU Vienna](http://www.boku.ac.at) are the principal investigators of SVD. 

## SVD collaborators

In addition to the SVD core group at BOKU Vienna, a growing number of collaborators plan to or 
actively work already with SVD. 

* [Ecosystem and Landscape ecology lab](http://landscape.zoology.wisc.edu/) (Monica Turner, Madison, WI, US). 
Goal of the collaboration is an upscaling of local modeling results to a larger scale (Greater Yellowstone National Park).


## SVD related projects

* [iLand](http://iland.boku.ac.at): iLand is a model of forest landscape dynamics, 
simulating individual tree competition, growth, mortality, and regeneration. 
It addresses interactions between climate (change), disturbance regimes, vegetation dynamics, and 
forest management. iLand was developed by the same core team as SVD, and data from iLand simulations
can be used within the SVD framework.
